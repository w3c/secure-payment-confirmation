# Introduction # {#sctn-intro}

*This section and its sub-sections are non-normative.*

This specification defines an API that enables the use of strong authentication
methods in payment flows on the web. It aims to provide the same authentication
benefits and user privacy focus as [[webauthn-3]] with enhancements to meet the
needs of payment processing.

Similarly to [[webauthn-3]], this specification defines two related processes
involving a user. The first is [[#sctn-registration]] (formerly "enrollment"),
where a relationship is created between the user and the [=Relying Party=]. The
second is [[#sctn-authentication]], where the user responds to a challenge from
the [=Relying Party=] (possibly via an intermediary payment service provider)
to consent to a specific payment.

It is a goal of this specification to reduce authentication friction during
checkout, and one aspect of that is to maximize the number of authentications
that the user can perform for a given registration. That is, with consent
from the [=Relying Party=], ideally the user could "register once" and
authenticate on any merchant origin (and via payment service provider),
not just the merchant origin where the user first registered.

To that end, an important feature of Secure Payment Confirmation is
that the merchant (or another entity) may initiate the authentication
ceremony on the [=Relying Party's=] behalf.

Functionally, this specification defines a new [=payment method=] for the
{{PaymentRequest}} API, and adds a [=WebAuthn Extension=] to extend
[[webauthn-3]] with payment-specific datastructures and to relax assumptions to
allow the API to be called in payment contexts.

## Use Cases ## {#sctn-use-cases}

Although [[webauthn-3]] provides general authentication capabilities for the
Web, the following use cases illustrate the value of the payment-specific
extension defined in this specification.

We presume that the general use case of cryptographic-based authentication for
online transactions is well established.

Note: These sections are still a WIP.

### Cryptographic evidence of transaction confirmation ### {#sctn-use-case-verifying-payment}

In many online payment systems, it is common for the entity (e.g., bank) that
issues a payment instrument to seek to reduce fraud through authentication.
[[webauthn-3]] and this specification make it possible to use authenticators to
cryptographically sign important payment-specific information such as the
origin of the merchant and the transaction amount and currency. The bank, as
the [=Relying Party=], can then verify the signed payment-specific information
as part of the decision to authorize the payment.

If the bank uses plain [[webauthn-3]], the payment-specific information to be
verified must be stored in the WebAuthn
{{PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions/challenge}}. This raises several issues:

1. It is a misuse of the `challenge` field (which is intended to defeat replay
    attacks).
1. There is no specification for this, so each bank is likely to have
    to devise its own format for how payment-specific information should be
    formatted and encoded in the challenge, complicating deployment and
    increasing fragmentation.
1. Regulations may require evidence that the user was shown and agreed to the
    payment-specific information. Plain [[webauthn-3]] does not provide for
    this display: there is no specified UX associated with information stored
    in the `challenge` field.

These limitations motivate the following Secure Payment Confirmation behaviors:

1. The `challenge` field is only used to defeat replay attacks, as with plain
    [[webauthn-3]].
1. SPC specifies a format for payment-specific information. This will enable
    development of generic verification code and test suites.
1. SPC guarantees that the user agent has presented the payment-specific
    information to the user in a way that a malicious website (or maliciously
    introduced JavaScript code on a trusted website) cannot bypass.

    * The payment-specific information is included in the
        {{CollectedClientData}} dictionary, which cannot be tampered with via
        JavaScript.

    NOTE: Banks and other stakeholders in the payments ecosystem trust payments
    via browsers sufficiently today using TLS, iframes, and other Web features.
    The current specification is designed to increase the security and usability
    of Web payments.

### Registration in a third-party iframe ### {#sctn-use-case-iframe-registration}

If a bank wishes to use [[webauthn-3]] as the [=Relying Party=], that
specification requires the bank to register the user in a first party context.
Registration can happen outside of a transaction while the user is visiting the
bank's site. It is also useful to be able to register the user during a
transaction, but any registration that interrupts the payment journey creates a
risk of transaction abandonment.

This limitation motivates the following Secure Payment Confirmation behavior:

1. SPC supports cross-origin registration from an iframe in a third-party
    context. For instance, this registration might take place following some
    other identity and verification (<abbr>ID&V</abbr>) flow (e.g., SMS OTP).

* See <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/1336#issuecomment-554170183">discussion
    on WebAuthn issue 1336</a>.

### Merchant control of authentication ### {#sctn-use-case-merchant-authentication}

Merchants seek to avoid user drop-off during checkout, in particular by
reducing authentication friction. A [=Relying Party=] (e.g., a bank) that
wishes to use [[webauthn-3]] to authenticate the user typically does so from an
iframe. However, merchants would prefer to manage the user experience of
authenticating the user while still enabling the [=Relying Party=] to verify
the results of authentication.

This limitation motivates the following Secure Payment Confirmation behavior:

* With SPC, other parties than the [=Relying Party=] can use authentication
    credentials *on behalf of* the Relying Party. The Relying Party can then
    verify the authentication results.

An additional benefit of this feature to Relying Parties is that they no longer
need to build their own front-end experiences for authentication. Instead,
payment service providers are likely to build them on behalf of merchants.

NOTE: Relying Parties that wish to provide the authentication user experience
may still do so using SPC from an iframe.

## Sample API Usage Scenarios ## {#sctn-sample-scenarios}

In this section, we walk through some scenarios for Secure Payment Confirmation
and the corresponding sample code for using this API. Note that these are
example flows and do not limit the scope of how the API can be used.

### Registration ### {#sctn-sample-registration}

This is the first-time flow, in which a new credential is created and stored by
an issuing bank.

1. The user visits `merchant.com`, selects an item to purchase, and proceeds to
    the checkout flow. They enter their payment instrument details, and indicate
    that they wish to pay (e.g., by pressing a "Pay" button).

1. The merchant communicates out-of-band (e.g., using another protocol) with the
    bank that issued the payment instrument. The issuing bank requests
    verification of the user, and provides a bank-controlled URL for the
    merchant to open in an iframe.

1. The merchant opens an iframe to `bank.com`, with the `allow` attribute set to
    "[=payment permission string|payment=]".

1. In the iframe, the issuing bank confirms the user's identity via a
    traditional means (e.g., SMS OTP). After confirmation, the bank invites the
    user to register in SPC authentication for future payments.

1. The user consents (e.g., by clicking an "Register" button in the bank UX),
    and the bank runs code in the iframe (see example below).

1. The user goes through a WebAuthn registration flow. A new credential is
    created and returned to the issuing bank who stores it in their server-side
    database associated with the user and payment instrument(s).

1. The verification completes; the bank iframe closes and the merchant finishes
    the checkout process for the user.

The sample code for registering the user follows:

<pre class="example" id="registration-example" highlight="js">
if (!window.PublicKeyCredential) { /* Client not capable. Handle error. */ }

const publicKey = {
  // The challenge should be created by the bank server and sent to the iframe.
  challenge: new Uint8Array([21,31,105 /* 29 more random bytes generated by the server */]),

  // Relying Party:
  rp: {
    name: "Fancy Bank",
  },

  // User:
  user: {
    // Part of WebAuthn. This information is not required by SPC
    // but may be used by the bank server to identify this user in
    // future transactions. Inconsistent values for the same user
    // can result in the creation of multiple credentials for the user
    // and thus potential UX friction due to credential selection.
    id: Uint8Array.from(window.atob("MIIBkzCCATigAwIBAjCCAZMwggE4oAMCAQIwggGTMII="), c=>c.charCodeAt(0)),
    name: "jane.doe@example.com",
    displayName: "Jane Doe",
  },

  // This Relying Party will accept either an ES256 or RS256 credential, but
  // prefers an ES256 credential.
  pubKeyCredParams: [
    {
      type: "public-key",
      alg: -7 // "ES256"
    },
    {
      type: "public-key",
      alg: -257 // "RS256"
    }
  ],

  // This Relying Party requires user verification.
  authenticatorSelection: {
    userVerification: "required",
    residentKey: "required",
    authenticatorAttachment: "platform",
  },

  timeout: 360000,  // 6 minutes

  // Indicate that this is an SPC credential. This is currently required to
  // allow credential creation in an iframe, and so that the browser knows this
  // credential relates to SPC.
  //
  // It is expected that a future version of the spec may remove the need for
  // this extension.
  extensions: {
    "payment": {
      isPayment: true,
    }
  }
};

// Note: The following call will cause the authenticator to display UI.
navigator.credentials.create({ publicKey })
  .then(function (newCredentialInfo) {
    // Send new credential info to server for verification and registration.
  }).catch(function (err) {
    // No acceptable authenticator or user refused consent. Handle appropriately.
  });
</pre>

</div> <!-- non-normative -->

### Authentication ### {#sctn-sample-authentication}

This is the flow when a user with an already registered credential is
performing a transaction and the issuing bank and merchant wish to use Secure
Payment Confirmation.

1. The user visits `merchant.com`, selects an item to purchase, and proceeds
    to the checkout flow. They enter their payment instrument details, and
    indicate that they wish to pay (e.g., by pressing a "Pay" button).

1. The merchant communicates out-of-band with the issuing bank of the payment
    instrument (e.g., using another protocol). The issuing bank requests
    verification of the user, and at the same time informs the merchant that it
    accepts SPC by providing the information necessary to use the API. This
    information includes a challenge and any credential IDs associated with this
    user and payment instrument(s).

1. The merchant runs the example code shown below.

1. The user agrees to the payment-specific information displayed in the SPC UX,
    and performs a subsequent WebAuthn authentication ceremony. The signed
    cryptogram is returned to the merchant.

1. The merchant communicates the signed cryptogram to the issuing bank
    out-of-band. The issuing bank verifies the cryptogram, and knows that the
    user is valid, what payment-specific information has been displayed, and
    that the user has consented to the transaction. The issuing bank authorizes
    the transaction and the merchant finishes the checkout process for the user.

The sample code for authenticating the user follows. Note that the example code
presumes access to await/async, for easier to read promise handling.

<pre class="example" id="authentication-example" highlight="js">
if (!window.PaymentRequest) { /* PaymentRequest not available; merchant should fallback to traditional flows */ }

const request = new PaymentRequest([{
  supportedMethods: "secure-payment-confirmation",
  data: {
    // List of credential IDs obtained from the bank.
    credentialIds,

    // The challenge is also obtained from the bank.
    challenge: new Uint8Array([21,31,105 /* 29 more random bytes generated by the bank */]),

    instrument: {
      displayName: "Fancy Card ****1234",
      icon: "https://fancybank.com/card-art.png",
    },

    payeeOrigin: "https://merchant.com",

    timeout: 360000,  // 6 minutes
  }], {
    total: {
      label: "Total",
      amount: {
        currency: "USD",
        value: "5.00",
      },
    },
  });

try {
  const canMakePayment = await request.canMakePayment();
  if (!canMakePayment) { throw new Error('Cannot make payment'); }

  const response = await request.show();
  await response.complete('success');

  // response.data is a PublicKeyCredential, with a clientDataJSON that
  // contains the transaction data for verification by the issuing bank.

  /* send response.data to the issuing bank for verification */
} catch (err) {
  /* SPC cannot be used; merchant should fallback to traditional flows */
}
</pre>

# Dependencies # {#sctn-dependencies}

This specification relies on several other underlying specifications, listed
below and in [[#index-defined-elsewhere]].

: <dfn>WebAuthn Conditional UI</dfn>
:: Secure Payment Confirmation only shows the transaction UX if one of the
    passed credentials is valid for the current device, without requiring a user
    interaction. This concept is not currently part of [[webauthn-3]], but is on
    the roadmap for a future enhancement.

    Until this is available, user agents can consider either storing a local
    cache of WebAuthn credentials created for this device, or always showing the
    transaction UX even if the user may be unable to complete the
    authentication.

    <div class="note">**TODO**: Bikeshed the name.</div>

    NOTE: To quickly support an initial SPC experiment, this API was designed
    atop existing implementations of the Payment Request and Payment Handler
    APIs. There is now general agreement to explore a design of SPC independent
    of Payment Request. We therefore expect (without a concrete timeline) that
    SPC will move away from its Payment Request origins. For developers, this
    should improve feature detection, invocation, and other aspects of the API.

# Registration # {#sctn-registration}

To register a user for Secure Payment Confirmation, relying parties should call
{{CredentialsContainer/create()|navigator.credentials.create()}}, with the
{{AuthenticationExtensionsClientInputs/payment}} [=WebAuthn Extension=]
specified.

Note: In this specification we define an extension in order to allow (1)
      credential creation in a cross-origin iframe (which WebAuthn does not yet
      allow) and (2) the browser to cache SPC credentials in the absence of
      [=WebAuthn Conditional UI=]. If these capabilities are available in future
      versions of WebAuthn, we may remove the requirement for the extension from
      SPC. Note that SPC credentials (with the extension) are otherwise
      full-fledged WebAuthn credentials. This specification does not preclude
      their use in other use-cases (e.g., login).

# Authentication # {#sctn-authentication}

To authenticate a payment via Secure Payment Confirmation, this specification
defines a new [=payment method=], "[=secure-payment-confirmation=]". This
payment method confirms the transaction with the user and then performs an
[=authentication ceremony=] to authenticate the user and create a signed blob
representing the authentication ceremony.

At a high level, authentication for Secure Payment Confirmation is similar to
[[webauthn-3]], with one major conceptual shift. Secure Payment Confirmation
allows a third-party (e.g., the merchant) to trigger an authentication ceremony
on behalf of the [=Relying Party=], passing in credentials that it has obtained
from the Relying Party on some other unspecified channel. See
[[#sctn-use-case-merchant-authentication]].

## Payment Method: Secure Payment Confirmation ## {#sctn-payment-method-spc}

This specification defines a new [=payment handler=], the <dfn>Secure Payment
Confirmation payment handler</dfn>, which handles requests to authenticate a
given payment.

<div class="note">
**TODO**: This specification also needs to monkey-patch step 12 of
{{PaymentRequest/constructor|PaymentRequest's constructor}} somehow, to enforce
that when "[=secure-payment-confirmation=]" is used, exactly one method is
given.
</div>

### Payment Method Identifier ### {#sctn-payment-method-identifier}

The [=standardized payment method identifier=] for the [=Secure Payment
Confirmation payment handler=] is "<dfn>secure-payment-confirmation</dfn>".

### Monkey-patch to [[payment-method-id]] ### {#sctn-monkey-patch-payment-method-id}

Add the following to the [=registry of standardized payment methods=] in
[[payment-method-id]]:

    : "[=secure-payment-confirmation=]"
    :: The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/secure-payment-confirmation/">Secure Payment Confirmation</a> specification.

### <dfn dictionary>SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest</dfn> Dictionary ### {#sctn-securepaymentconfirmationrequest-dictionary}

<xmp class="idl">
    dictionary SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest {
        required BufferSource challenge;
        required FrozenArray<BufferSource> credentialIds;
        required PaymentCredentialInstrument instrument;
        unsigned long timeout;
        required USVString payeeOrigin;
        AuthenticationExtensionsClientInputs extensions;
    };
</xmp>

The {{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest}} dictionary contains the following
members:

<dl dfn-type="dict-member" dfn-for="SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest">
    :  <dfn>challenge</dfn> member
    :: A random challenge that the relying party generates on the server side
        to prevent replay attacks.

    :  <dfn>credentialIds</dfn> member
    :: The list of credential identifiers for the given instrument.

    :  <dfn>instrument</dfn> member
    :: The description of the instrument name and icon to display during
        registration and to be signed along with the transaction details.

    :  <dfn>timeout</dfn> member
    :: The number of milliseconds before the request to sign the transaction
        details times out. At most 1 hour.

    :  <dfn>payeeOrigin</dfn> member
    :: The [=/origin=] of the payee that this SPC call is for (e.g., the
        merchant).

    :  <dfn>extensions</dfn> member
    :: Any [=WebAuthn extensions=] that should be used for the passed
        credential(s). The caller does not need to specify the
        [[#sctn-payment-extension-registration| payment extension]]; it is added
        automatically.
</dl>

### Steps to check if a payment can be made ### {#sctn-steps-to-check-if-a-payment-can-be-made}

The [=steps to check if a payment can be made=] for this payment method, for an
input {{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest}} |data|, are:

1. If |data|["{{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest/credentialIds}}"] is empty,
    return `false`.

1. Let |parsedURL| be the result of running the [=URL parser=] on
    |data|["{{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest/payeeOrigin}}"].

1. If |parsedURL| is failure, then return `false`.

1. If |parsedURL|'s [=url/scheme=] is not "`https`", then return `false`.

1. Set |data|["{{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest/payeeOrigin}}"] to the
    [=serialization of an origin|serialization of=] |parsedURL|'s [=url/origin=].

1. If |data|["{{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest/instrument}}"]["{{PaymentCredentialInstrument/displayName}}"]
    is empty, return `false`.

1. [=fetch an image resource|Fetch the image resource=] for the icon, passing «["{{ImageResource/src}}" →
    |data|["{{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest/instrument}}"]["{{PaymentCredentialInstrument/icon}}"]]»
    for *image*. If this fails, return `false`.

    Note: The image resource must be fetched whether or not any credential
    matches, to defeat attempts to [[#sctn-privacy-probing-credential-ids|probe
    for credential existence]].

1. Optionally, the user agent may elect to return `false`. If a user agent does
    so, it must take care to maintain [[#sctn-privacy-probing-credential-ids|authentication
    ceremony privacy]], e.g., by presenting an alternative UI to the user such
    that the website cannot detect the difference between no-matching
    credentials and the user declining to authenticate.

1. Return `true`.

### Displaying a transaction confirmation UX ### {#sctn-transaction-confirmation-ux}

To avoid restricting User Agent implementation choice, this specification does
not require a User Agent to display a particular user interface when
{{PaymentRequest/show|PaymentRequest.show()}} is called and the [=Secure
Payment Confirmation payment handler=] is selected. However, so that a
[=Relying Party=] can trust the information included in
{{CollectedClientPaymentData}}, the User Agent MUST ensure that the following
is communicated to the user and that the user's consent is collected for the
authentication:

* The {{CollectedClientAdditionalPaymentData/payeeOrigin}}.
* The {{CollectedClientAdditionalPaymentData/total}}, that is the
    {{PaymentCurrencyAmount/currency}} and {{PaymentCurrencyAmount/value}} of the
    transaction.
* The {{CollectedClientAdditionalPaymentData/instrument}} details, that is the
    payment instrument {{PaymentCredentialInstrument/displayName}} and
    {{PaymentCredentialInstrument/icon}}.

If the [=current transaction automation mode=] is not
"{{TransactionAutomationMode/none}}", the user agent should first verify that
it is in an automation context (see [[WebDriver#security|WebDriver's Security
considerations]]). The user agent should then bypass the above communication of
information and gathering of user consent, and instead do the following based
on the value of the [=current transaction automation mode=]:

    : "{{TransactionAutomationMode/autoaccept}}"
    :: Act as if the user has seen the transaction details and accepted
        the authentication.

    : "{{TransactionAutomationMode/autoreject}}"
    :: Act as if the user has seen the transaction details and rejected
        the authentication.

### Steps to respond to a payment request ### {#sctn-steps-to-respond-to-a-payment-request}

The [=steps to respond to a payment request=] for this payment method, for a given
{{PaymentRequest}} |request| and {{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest}} |data|, are:

1. Let |topOrigin| be the [=top-level origin=] of the [=relevant settings object=] of |request|.

1. Let |payment| be a new a {{AuthenticationExtensionsPaymentInputs}} dictionary,
    whose fields are:

    : {{AuthenticationExtensionsPaymentInputs/isPayment}}
    :: The boolean value `true`.
    : {{AuthenticationExtensionsPaymentInputs/rp}}
    :: **TODO**
    : {{AuthenticationExtensionsPaymentInputs/topOrigin}}
    :: |topOrigin|
    : {{AuthenticationExtensionsPaymentInputs/payeeOrigin}}
    :: |data|["{{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest/payeeOrigin}}"]
    : {{AuthenticationExtensionsPaymentInputs/total}}
    :: |request|.[=payment request details|[[details]]=]["{{PaymentDetailsInit/total}}"]
    : {{AuthenticationExtensionsPaymentInputs/instrument}}
    :: |data|["{{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest/instrument}}"]

    <div class="note">**TODO**: We do not have the rp id at this step; maybe that should just go in the extension processing steps?</div>

1. Let |extensions| be a new {{AuthenticationExtensionsClientInputs}} dictionary
    whose {{AuthenticationExtensionsClientInputs/payment}} member is set to
    |payment|, and whose other members are set from
    |data|["{{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest/extensions}}"].

1. Let |publicKeyOpts| be a new {{PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions}}
    dictionary, whose fields are:

    : {{PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions/challenge}}
    :: |data|["{{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest/challenge}}"]
    : {{PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions/timeout}}
    :: |data|["{{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest/timeout}}"]
    : {{PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions/userVerification}}
    :: {{UserVerificationRequirement/required}}
    : {{PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions/extensions}}
    :: |extensions|

    Note: This algorithm hard-codes "required" as the value for {{PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions/userVerification}}, because that is what Chrome's initial implementation supports. The current limitations may change. The Working Group invites implementers to share use cases that would benefit from support for other values (e.g., "preferred" or "discouraged").

1. For each |id| in |data|["{{SecurePaymentConfirmationRequest/credentialIds}}"]:

    1. Let |descriptor| be a new {{PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor}} dictionary,
        whose fields are:

        : {{PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor/type}}
        :: {{PublicKeyCredentialType/public-key}}
        : {{PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor/id}}
        :: |id|
        : {{PublicKeyCredentialDescriptor/transports}}
        :: A sequence of length 1 whose only member is
            {{AuthenticatorTransport/internal}}.

# WebAuthn Extension - "`payment`" # {#sctn-payment-extension-registration}

This [=client extension|client=] [=registration extension=] and
[=authentication extension=] indicates that a credential is either being
created for or used for Secure Payment Confirmation, respectively.

For registration, this extension relaxes the WebAuthn requirements to allow
credential creation in a cross-origin iframe, and also allows the browser to
identify and cache Secure Payment Confirmation credentials. For authentication,
this extension allows a third-party to perform an authentication ceremony on
behalf of the [=Relying Party=], and also adds transaction information to the
signed cryptogram.

Notably, a website should not call
{{CredentialsContainer/get()|navigator.credentials.get()}} with this extension
directly; for authentication the extension can only be accessed via
{{PaymentRequest}} with a "[=secure-payment-confirmation=]" payment method.

         [=Relying Party=]. They can improve reliability (e.g., in the case that
         the icon hosting server may be unavailable). They can also enhance
         validation because the [=Relying Party=]  has cryptographic evidence of
         what the browser displayed to the user: the icon URL is signed as part
         of the {{CollectedClientAdditionalPaymentData}} structure.

# Permissions Policy integration # {#sctn-permissions-policy}

This specification uses the "[=payment permission string|payment=]"
policy-identifier string from [[payment-request]] to control access to **both**
registration and authentication. This extends the
[[webauthn-3#sctn-permissions-policy|WebAuthn Permission Policy]].

Note: Algorithms specified in [[!CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT-1]] perform the actual
permissions policy evaluation. This is because such policy evaluation needs to
occur when there is access to the [=current settings object=]. The
{{PublicKeyCredential/[[Create]](origin, options, sameOriginWithAncestors)}}

# SPC Relying Party Operations # {#sctn-relying-party-operations}

## Verifying an Authentication Assertion ## {#sctn-verifying-assertion}

In order to perform an [=authentication ceremony=] for Secure Payment
Confirmation, the [=Relying Party=] MUST proceed as follows:

1. Let |credential| be a {{PublicKeyCredential}} returned from a successful
    invocation of the [=Secure Payment Confirmation payment handler=] by the
    |SPC caller|.

    Note: As SPC is designed to enable [[#sctn-use-case-merchant-authentication|merchant
    control of authentication]], the entity that invokes SPC may not be the
    [=Relying Party=]. This first step presumes that the SPC caller has returned
    a credential obtained via SPC to the [=Relying Party=].

1. Perform steps 3-21 [[webauthn-3#sctn-verifying-assertion| as specified in
    WebAuthn]], with the following changes:

    1. In step 5, verify that |credential|.{{Credential/id}} identifies one of
        the public key credentials provided to the |SPC caller| by the [=Relying Party=].

    1. In step 11, verify that the value of |C|["{{CollectedClientData/type}}"]
        is the string `payment.get`.

    1. In step 12, verify that the value of |C|["{{CollectedClientData/challenge}}"]
        equals the base64url encoding of the challenge provided to the
        |SPC caller| by the [=Relying Party=].

    1. In step 13, verify that the value of |C|["{{CollectedClientData/origin}}"]
        matches the origin that the [=Relying Party=] expects SPC to have been
        called from.

    1. After step 13, insert the following steps:

        * Verify that the value of |C|["{{CollectedClientPaymentData/payment}}"]["{{CollectedClientAdditionalPaymentData/rp}}"]
            matches the [=Relying Party=]'s origin.

        * Verify that the value of |C|["{{CollectedClientPaymentData/payment}}"]["{{CollectedClientAdditionalPaymentData/topOrigin}}"]
            matches the top-level origin that the [=Relying Party=] expects.

        * Verify that the value of |C|["{{CollectedClientPaymentData/payment}}"]["{{CollectedClientAdditionalPaymentData/payeeOrigin}}"]
            matches the origin of the payee that should have been displayed to the user.

        * Verify that the value of |C|["{{CollectedClientPaymentData/payment}}"]["{{CollectedClientAdditionalPaymentData/total}}"]
            matches the transaction amount that should have been displayed to the user.

        * Verify that the value of |C|["{{CollectedClientPaymentData/payment}}"]["{{CollectedClientAdditionalPaymentData/instrument}}"]
            matches the payment instrument details that should have been displayed to the user.

</figure>

The [=remote end steps=] are:

1. If |parameters| is not a JSON [=Object=], return a [=WebDriver error=] with
     [=WebDriver error code=] [=invalid argument=].

1. Let |mode| be the result of [=getting a property=] named `"mode"` from
    |parameters|.

1. If |mode| is [=undefined=] or is not a member of {{TransactionAutomationMode}},
    return a [=WebDriver error=] with [=WebDriver error code=] [=invalid
    argument=].

1. Set the [=current transaction automation mode=] to |mode|.

1. Return [=success=] with data `null`.

# Security Considerations # {#sctn-security-considerations}

As this specification builds on top of WebAuthn, the
[[webauthn-3#sctn-security-considerations|WebAuthn Security Considerations]]
are applicable. The below subsections comprise the current Secure Payment
Confirmation-specific security considerations, where this specification
diverges from WebAuthn.

## Cross-origin authentication ceremony ## {#sctn-security-cross-origin-auth}

A significant departure that Secure Payment Confirmation makes from WebAuthn is
in allowing a third-party to initiate an authentication ceremony using
credentials for a different [=Relying Party=], and returning the assertion to
the third party. This feature can expose [=Relying Parties=] to both login and
payment attacks, which are discussed here.

### Login Attack ### {#sctn-security-login-attack}

As credentials created for Secure Payment Confirmation are valid WebAuthn
credentials, it is possible that a [=Relying Party=] may wish to use the same
credential for a given user for both login and payment. This allows a potential
attack on the [=Relying Party's=] login system, if they do not carefully verify
the assertion they receive.

The attack is as follows:

1. The user visits `attacker.com`, which is or pretends to be a merchant site.
1. `attacker.com` obtains credentials for the user from `relyingparty.com`,
     either legitimately or by stealing them from `relyingparty.com` or another
     party with whom `relyingparty.com` had shared the credentials.
1. `attacker.com` initiates SPC authentication, and the user agrees to the
     transaction (which may or may not be legitimate).
1. `attacker.com` takes the payment assertion that they received from the API
     call, and sends it to the login endpoint for `relyingparty.com`, e.g. by
     sending a POST to `https://relyingparty.com/login`.
1. `relyingparty.com` is employing faulty assertion validation code, which
     checks the signature but fails to validate the necessary fields (see
     below), and believes the login attempt to be legitimate.
1. `relyingparty.com` returns e.g. a login cookie to `attacker.com`. The user's
     account at `relyingparty.com` has now been compromised.

[=Relying Parties=] can guard against this attack in two ways.

Firstly, a [=Relying Party=] must always follow the correct assertion
validation steps either for [[webauthn-3#sctn-verifying-assertion|WebAuthn
login]] or [[#sctn-verifying-assertion|SPC payment]] as appropriate. In
particular, the following fields can all be used to detect an inappropriate use
of a credential:

* {{CollectedClientData}}["{{CollectedClientData/type}}"]- "webauthn.get" for
    login, "payment.get" for SPC.
* {{CollectedClientData}}["{{CollectedClientData/challenge}}"] - this value should
    be provided by the [=Relying Party=] server to the site ahead of any call
    to either WebAuthn or SPC, and should be verified as matching an expected,
    appropriate, previously-provided value.
* {{CollectedClientData}}["{{CollectedClientData/origin}}"] - if SPC is being
    performed cross-origin, this value will contain the origin of the caller
    (e.g. `attacker.com` in the above example).

Secondly, a [=Relying Party=] can consider keeping their payment and login
credentials separate. If doing this, the [=Relying Party=] should only register
credentials for Secure Payment Confirmation on a subdomain (e.g.
`https//payment.relyingparty.com`), and should keep payment credentials and
login credentials separate in their database.

<div class="note">
NOTE: As currently written, the Secure Payment Confirmation specification
      allows any WebAuthn credential to be used in an SPC authentication.
      However this is not true in implementations today, which only allow
      credentials created with the {{AuthenticationExtensionsClientInputs/payment}}
      extension specified to participate in SPC authentication, and the
      specification may be updated to reflect that in the future.

      In both implementation and specification today, a credential created
      with the {{AuthenticationExtensionsClientInputs/payment}} can be used
      for login, if the Relying Party wishes. This is not expected to change.
</div>

### Payment Attack ### {#sctn-security-payment-attack}

A Secure Payment Confirmation assertion is essentially useless unless
it is part of an ongoing online transaction.

A variety of mechanisms protect against an attack where a malicious
third-party, instead of attempting to hijack a user account, initiates
an unauthorized payment using Secure Payment Confirmation credentials
(obtained either legitimately or otherwise):

* When the attacker initiates SPC, the user will be shown UI by the
    User Agent that clearly states the transaction details (including the payee
    and amount). The user is very likely to "cancel" in this scenario.
* If the user does agree to the transaction, and completes the subsequent
    WebAuthn authentication ceremony, the attacker now has a signed SPC
    assertion for the [=Relying Party=].
* If the [=Relying Party=] is not expecting a transaction, it will reject the
    assertion.
* If the [=Relying Party=] is expecting a transaction, it will detect an
    unfamiliar `challenge` and reject the assertion.

## Merchant-supplied authentication data ## {#sctn-security-merchant-data}

The bank can and should protect against spoofing by
[[#sctn-verifying-assertion|verifying the authentication assertion]] they receive to
ensure it aligns with the transaction details provided by the
merchant.

That is because a consequence of this specification's third-party
authentication ceremony is that even in a valid transaction (i.e. one
that the [=Relying Party=] is expecting), a third-party provides the
transaction details that are shown to the user:

* Transaction amount and currency
* Payment instrument name and icon
* Payee origin

This could lead to a spoofing attack, in which a merchant presents incorrect
data to the user. For example, the merchant could tell the bank (in the
backend) that it is initiating a purchase of $100, but then pass $1 to the SPC
API (and thus show the user a $1 transaction to verify). Or the merchant
could provide the correct transaction details but pass Secure Payment
Confirmation credentials that don't match what the [=Relying Party=]
expects.

Secure Payment Confirmation actually makes defeating this kind of attack easier
than it currently is on the web. In online payments today, the bank has to
trust that the merchant showed the user the correct amount in their checkout
flow (and any fraud discoveries are post-payment, when the user checks their
account statement).

# Privacy Considerations # {#sctn-privacy-considerations}

As this specification builds on top of WebAuthn, the
[[webauthn-3#sctn-privacy-considerations|WebAuthn Privacy Considerations]] are
applicable. The below subsections comprise the current Secure Payment
Confirmation-specific privacy considerations, where this specification diverges
from WebAuthn.

## Registration in a Cross-Origin iframe ## {#sctn-security-cross-origin-registration}

Unlike WebAuthn, this specification allows the creation of credentials in a
cross-origin iframe (as long as the appropriate
[[#sctn-permissions-policy|Permission Policy]] is set on the iframe). That is,
if site A embeds an iframe from site B, with the "[=payment permission
string|payment=]" policy set, then site B may initiate a credential creation
for site B within that iframe.

NOTE: Allowing credential creation in cross-origin iframes is currently [under
      discussion](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/1656) in the WebAuthn
      Working Group, and thus may move from this specification to WebAuthn in
      the future.

A [previously described
attack](https://github.com/w3c/webauthn/issues/1336#issue-513568855) on this
feature exists. In it, a malicious iframe (`https://website.tracker`) initiates
credential creation, attempting to trick the user into thinking that the
WebAuthn credential creation is for logging into the legitimate parent site
(`https://example.org`). The user creates the credential. The malicious actor
can then later utilize `get()` in a cross-origin iframe (again, timing the call
to coincide with a login attempt to `https://example.org`) to have the user
accidentally identify themselves to the tracker iframe.

This attack, however, presumes that `https://website.tracker` already has
script access to `https://example.org` (in order to create the attacker iframe,
with the appropriate permissions set). If this is true, then
`https://website.tracker` can already directly track the user, for example by:

* Identifying them from the username they provide when logging in to
    `https://example.org`, OR
* Creating a WebAuthn credential for `https://example.org` (in the main frame),
    saving that to a `https://website.tracker` server, and later using that
    credential (again in the main frame) to identify and track the user.

<div class="note">
**TODO**: The above-described attack does allow `https://website.tracker` to
          track the user across multiple parent sites that it is directly
          included in, using the credential as a cross-site identifier. The
          above counter-claims stand up less well there, so we should perhaps
          remove them.
</div>

In the absence of script access to the main frame, the ability for a malicious
iframe to perform an attack like this seems far less feasible.  Firstly, the
main frame must have granted the malicious iframe
[[#sctn-permissions-policy|permission]] to call the API. Secondly, the iframe
has no way to know when the user is logging into `https://example.org`, to
align their attack. 

A consideration for a future version of this specification might be to
additionally require consuming a [=transient activation=] for credential
creation in a cross-origin iframe, to ensure that the user has at least
interacted with an iframe attempting credential creation.

## Probing for credential ids ## {#sctn-privacy-probing-credential-ids}

As per WebAuthn's section on [[webauthn-3#sctn-assertion-privacy|Authentication
Ceremony Privacy]], implementors of Secure Payment Confirmation must make sure
not to enable malicious callers (who now may not even be the [=Relying Party=])
to distinguish between these cases:

* A credential is not available.
* A credential is available, but the user does not consent to use it.

For example, consider an implementation that does not download the payment
instrument icon unless a credential matches. A caller could then provide an
unique URL that they control for the payment instrument icon. If the URL is
accessed then the caller can conclude that at least one of the passed
credentials is available to the user.

## Joining different payment instruments ## {#sctn-privacy-joining-payment-instruments}

If a [=Relying Party=] uses the same credentials for a given user across
multiple payment instruments, this might allow a merchant to join information
about payment instruments that might otherwise not be linked. That is, across
two different transactions that a user U performs with payment instruments P1
and P2 (either on the same merchant M, or two colluding merchants M1 and M2),
the merchant(s) may now be able to learn that P1 and P2 are for the same user.

For many current online payment flows this may not be a significant concern, as
the user already provides sufficient information to do this joining anyway
(e.g. their address), however it could become a privacy attack if, e.g.,
payment tokenization becomes commonplace.

One possible way to defeat this may be to hash the credential IDs with a random
salt from the Account Provider ([=Relying Party=]):

1. Merchant requests the list of credential IDs from the Account Provider.
1. Account Provider generates a random salt.
1. Account Provider sends `[salt, hash(salt || credential ID)]` to the merchant.
1. Merchant invokes SPC with the hashed credential ID and additionally passes
     the `salt` into the API.
1. The browser generates `hash(salt || credential ID)` for each of the
     credential IDs that it has stored in the user profile.
1. If any of the hashes match what the merchant provided, then a credential
     match has been found.

NOTE: If SPC relies on [=WebAuthn Conditional UI=] in the future, that API
      would have to support this salt-ing concept as the browser would not have
      a local list of credentials.

See [this issue](https://github.com/w3c/secure-payment-confirmation/issues/77)
for more details.

## Credential ID(s) as a tracking vector ## {#sctn-privacy-credential-id-tracking-vector}

Even for a single payment instrument, the credential ID(s) returned by the
[=Relying Party=] could be used by a malicious entity as a tracking vector, as
they are strong, cross-site identifiers. However in order to obtain them from
the [=Relying Party=], the merchant already needs an as-strong identifier to
give to the [=Relying Party=] (e.g., the credit card number).

As above, a possible solution to this would be to hash the credential ID(s)
with a random salt, making them non-consistent across calls.

# Accessibility Considerations # {#sctn-accessibility-considerations}

User agents render the {{PaymentCredentialInstrument/icon}} and {{PaymentCredentialInstrument/displayName}} together. Relying parties ensure the accessibility of the icon presentation by providing sufficient information via the {{PaymentCredentialInstrument/displayName}} (e.g., if the icon represents a bank, by including the bank name in the {{PaymentCredentialInstrument/displayName}}).

User Agents implementing this specification should follow both
[[webauthn-3#sctn-accessiblility-considerations|WebAuthn's Accessibility Considerations]]
and [=payment request accessibility considerations|PaymentRequest's Accessibility Considerations=].
